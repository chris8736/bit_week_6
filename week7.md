**Intro**

Introduce us as Bit members
Announce goals:
- finding music and particle assets on the web / asset store
- discussion of licensing
- using those assets in a project to their fullest
    
Show off demo of what’s to happen

**Part 1**

[insert link to demo project here]

Finding new assets
- audio assets at https://freesound.org
- free particle assets at https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/unity-particle-pack-5-x-73777

Everything at freesound has a creative commons license, so they're safe to use in any commercial project. Most assets in the official store are the same, but be mindful of this as you go hunting the web for resources!

**Part 2**

Messing with audio sources
- play audio oneshots or loops upon starting the game
- adjust pitch / speed / volume in editor and through script
- tie audio to a collision between player and floor

**Part 3**

Messing with particle systems
- play with default particle system
- show off particle “recipes” (settings that let you transform the default into something interesting)
- edit those prebuilt particle systems, like tweaking size, shape, etc.

**Activities**

- Navigate to https://freesound.org and find an audio file to link with “jumping”
- Adjust those assets to your liking within Unity

**Homework**

- Find some audio files from the internet, or record your own
- Find a tutorial online about making a custom particle effect
- Tie both assets to some in-game event
